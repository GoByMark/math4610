## Xiang's (Mark's) 4610 Webpage

This repository is dedicated to the course work for Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics at Utah State University (USU) during the Fall Semester of 2021.

For this course, I will use the Python Programming language, with the Terminal on Mac to compile files. I will use PyCharm as a text editor for my code. LaTeX will be used supplementally for documentation purposes.
